SECTION 4: DATA VERSIONING - COMPLETE 
========================================

1. DVC Implementation 
   - DVC initialized in project
   - All 7 dataset versions tracked
   - .dvc metadata files created
   - Git integration configured

2. Documentation of Data Modifications 
   - Complete version history documented
   - 7 dataset versions tracked (v1.0 to v4.2)
   - Each transformation explained with rationale
   - Code snippets provided for reproducibility

3. Change Log/History 
   - Detailed changelog for each version
   - Transformation impact documented
   - Data quality metrics tracked
   - Class balance verified at each stage

Dataset Pipeline Summary
========================
v1.0: Original (666 × 12)
  ↓  [Remove 44 duplicates, create binary target]
v2.0: Cleaned (622 × 13)
  ↓  [Group categories, encode features]
v3.0: Encoded (622 × 35)
  ↓  [Feature selection]
v3.1: Preprocessed (622 × 30)
  ↓  [Apply StandardScaler]
v4.0: Scaled (622 × 31)
  ↓  [80/20 stratified split]
v4.1: Train (497 × 31) + v4.2: Test (125 × 31)

Key Metrics
===========
- Total data loss: 44 rows (6.6%) - duplicates only
- Feature expansion: 12 → 31 features
- Missing values: 0 (100% complete)
- Final class balance: 55.6% / 44.4%
- Reproducibility: (random_state=42)

Next Steps
==========
→ Proceed to Model Building (Deliverable 5)
→ Use versioned train/test datasets
→ Track experiments with DVC pipelines
