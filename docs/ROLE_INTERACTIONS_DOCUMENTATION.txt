DECISION LOG
=============

Decision 1: Binary Classification Approach
  - Who: Data Scientist, ML Engineer
  - Rationale: Simplifies problem, improves model performance
  - Impact: Changed from 4-class to 2-class problem

Decision 2: SVM as Final Model
  - Who: ML Engineer (lead), Data Scientist (approved)
  - Rationale: Best test accuracy (71.2%) after tuning
  - Trade-offs: Linear kernel chosen for interpretability

Decision 3: StandardScaler for Feature Scaling
  - Who: ML Engineer, Data Scientist
  - Rationale: Ordinal features need normalization, binary features stay 0/1
  - Alternative considered: MinMaxScaler (rejected - less robust to outliers)

Decision 4: 80/20 Train-Test Split
  - Who: ML Engineer
  - Rationale: Standard practice, sufficient test samples (125)
  - Stratification: Applied to maintain class balance
